        <h3>Linkin Park</h3>
        <p>Chester was frustrated at not being able to find a band after leaving Grey Daze and even thought about quitting singing. He was offered an audition for Linkin Park by the vice president of Zomba Music in Los Angeles. He had a successful audition
          for the band, named at the time Xero, and managed to record the song for his audition in a day. After failing to find a record deal and facing numerous rejections they finally landed a deal with Warner Bros. Records In 2000 Linkin Park released
          their debut album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_Theory" target="_blank" id="tribute-link"> Hybrid Theory.</a></p>

        <p>In February 2013 STP parted ways with their lead singer and the band recruited Chester as a replacement later in May 2013, he took to the stage for the first time in May 2013 with the band. Chester reflected on joining Stone Temple Pilots, stating,
          "Every band has its own kind of vibe. Stone Temple Pilots has this sexier, more classic rock feel to it. Linkin Park is a very modern, very tech-heavy type of band. I grew up listening to these guys. When this opportunity came up, it was just
          like a no-brainer." Bennington stated in interviews that singing lead vocals in Stone Temple Pilots was his lifelong dream. He left the band on good terms due to his commitments with Linkin Park in 2015</p>
