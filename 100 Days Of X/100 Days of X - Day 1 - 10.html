<h2>Day: 1 March 29th 2018</h2>

<p>Todays Progress: Managed to sign into the Beta and noticed that there are additional challenges in the RWD section that have been added recently.
Worked my way through a few of these and added them into the folders for their section.</p>

<p>Thoughts: If there is still things they are adding then I may need to keep an eye on the beta challenges, things added might come in handy for making my projects look better.</p>

<p>Todays Progress: Had the weekend off and also yesterday. Working through the rest of the RWD sections of the beta for FCC. Theres a number of challenges that have been added since I first went through it. All I am doing is doing the challenge then saving them in their folder on my github</p>
