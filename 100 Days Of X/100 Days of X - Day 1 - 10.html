<p>Todays Progress: Managed to sign into the Beta and noticed that there are additional challenges in the RWD section that have been added recently.
Worked my way through a few of these and added them into the folders for their section.</p>

<p>Thoughts: If there is still things they are adding then I may need to keep an eye on the beta challenges, things added might come in handy for making my projects look better.</p>
