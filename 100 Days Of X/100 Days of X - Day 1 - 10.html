<h2>Day: 1 March 29th 2018</h2>

<p>Todays Progress: Managed to sign into the Beta and noticed that there are additional challenges in the RWD section that have been added recently.
Worked my way through a few of these and added them into the folders for their section.</p>

<p>Thoughts: If there is still things they are adding then I may need to keep an eye on the beta challenges, things added might come in handy for making my projects look better.</p>

<h2>Day: 2 April 3rd 2018</h2>

<p>Todays Progress: Had the weekend off and also yesterday. Working through the rest of the RWD sections of the beta for FCC. Theres a number of challenges that have been added since I first went through it. All I am doing is doing the challenge then saving them in their folder on my github</p>

<h2>Day: 3 April 4th 2018</h2>

<p>Todays Progress: Started CSS Grid on the beta for FCC also stumbled upon a podcast called Programming Thorwdown which seems good. Listened to the first podcast and they went over C++.

Also on my way to work I have been using the solo learn app for JS. Finding it quite good and makes the commute go in quickly</p>

<p>Thoughts: Front End Masters has started Paths and I am already 11% into the beginners videos which is good. I need to continue to watch the Intro to Web Dev videos</p>

<h1> Dont know what day it is on this but I am now in DPD in my work! Start CodeClan on the 14th May and start back in DPD when I am finished in Sept.</h1>


<h2>Starting pre course work today</h2>

<p>Got the MAC from work and Ian help me set it up, so now I am going to try and learn how to code using this MAC book.</p>
<p>Downloaded the script from codeclan and its installed ATOM which is what I am using to edit this but I dont really like it, think I just got used to sublime text. Wonder if I can change some of the settings on this. I shall need to google guides.</p>
<p>Hoping I can make a start on the pre course work today at some point, even if its just watching the video on how to use a MAC. </p>
